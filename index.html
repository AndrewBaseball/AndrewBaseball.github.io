          <h2>Carbon Capture Technologies Greatly Reduce CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</h2>
          <p style="font-size:14px;"> Last year, we emitted 5130 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. The CO<sub>2</sub> causes heat to be trapped in the atmosphere and creates warmer temperatures. If we don't take action, the global temperature will continue to increase causing icebergs to melt and ecosystems to be destroyed. </p>
        </div> 
        <div>
          <h2>Our Goal is to Remove 100 Million Tons of CO<sub>2</sub> by 2027.
          <p style="font-size: 14px;"> At FILTR we remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere using Carbon Capture technologies. We use the carbon we capture to create many useful products such as fertilizer, metal, and building blocks. To achieve this goal, we work on taking carbon away from the source such as power plants, factories, and transportation. Although this may not stop all emissions, we can slow down climate change until we have newer technologies to reach net zero emissions. </p>
        </div>
          <h2>The FILTR Team</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 14px;">FILTR is a company where we want to change the world, and make it a <b>cleaner</b> place.  FILTR is a product where we use some of the best technology to extract Carbon Dioxide from ordinary gases and trap it, to have our air cleaner.  Our company slows down the rate of global warming, while making our products, not only affordable, but meaningful. 
          FILTR came together when we met at a summer camp in Palo Alto, CA.  All four of the founders showed a certain passion for climate change and wanting to stop it, so we came up with a revolutionary idea, a carbon capture filter that could fit on a car or smokestack.  Then, the FILTR was born, created in 2019, The FILTR has dominated over other climate 
          change companies just by making their products affordable and portable, without being a pain in the ass.  Alright, now lets run it back... The four founders, Conrad Lui, Andrew Reed, Mitali Anandikar, and Kavan Zia were just lowlyers from Palo Alto and Los Altos, CA.  They never really knew each other, let alone knew each others names, but just in a couple of years, 
           they never knew that they would be running a 15 million dollar company. </p>
         
          <h2>The Numbers and Growth of FILTR</h2>
